# Amazon: Client Behavioral Analysis

---

## Introduction

According to the data I used, in mid-Q2 2023, Amazon's shopping platform saw a rise in negative sentiment from customers on various social media platforms. Early observations suggest that customers were dissatisfied with Amazon's platform, particularly regarding feature updates carried out by the Product Management Team.

The Amazon Product Management Team conducted an online survey of several of their customers (600 randomly sampled) at the end of Q2 2023 (June). The objective of the EDA below is to help the Product Management Team analyze customer satisfaction with their features, validate issues, identify pain points, and prioritize problem-solving strategies.

The survey results uncovered numerous factors affecting the decrease in customer satisfaction with Amazon. The following exploratory data analysis (EDA) specifically examines the new shopping recommendation feature that was recently updated. The aim is to use the visual analysis findings as a foundation for gaining comprehensive insights based on data, specifically regarding customer satisfaction with the recommendation feature. Subsequently, the Product Management Team can implement the required measures to enhance customer satisfaction and experience in the future.
